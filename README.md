# HAPI-Sample-Android
Sample Android App demonstrating the use of HAPI APIs

This sample Android app is written in java and demonstrates how to use HAPI to login, navigate files and folder published in Active Directory, download a file to the device, and upload a local device file into Active Directory. This app demonstrates a small subset of HAPI functionality. The app was written in java using the latest Android SDK and Android Studio 1.2.2. By default, the app makes calls to the HAPI Gatekeeper in our sandbox environment, which is supported by a HAPI Gateway and sandbox Active Directory instance. FullArmor can supply a temporary sandbox Active Directory account, complete with sample data, upon request.
